# FPGA-Implementation-of-STOMP-in-Robotics
This repository contains the FPGA implementation of STOMP algorithm in robotics using SYCL based on oneAPI. The SYCL code is also connected with ROS2 for simulation. This repo can be used as a starting point for furture deveploment in connecting FPGA with robotics. The workflow provided can be used as the bridge connecting fpga code and ROS2.
